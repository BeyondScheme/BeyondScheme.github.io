Angular2 was released October this year. On the Internet you can find more and more tutorials which shows how to build a simple application. This tutorial is quite different from them. It shows how to build an Angular 2 application where we're going to focus on architecture which will periodically pull data from backend to keep fresh data on UI.

__After this tutorial you will know:__

* how to set up angular2 project (using gulp + tslint) and build discussion portal,
* how to build a proper architecture (using angular2 + rxjs),
* how to create components which will periodically pull date from backend,

Let's start with watching a quick demo how this project works.

# 1 Set up project

The whole project is available on [github](https://github.com/BeyondScheme/angular2-discussion-portal). Please follow instructions written in a [README](https://github.com/BeyondScheme/angular2-discussion-portal/blob/master/README.md) file to run the project. 

What we are going to use while building project:

* lite-server - server which we will use to run the project,
* json-server - it is needed for simple db with restful api (we'll share data between each app instance so that's why I didn't choose `angular-in-memory-web-api`),
* gulp - tool to build our application,
* tslint - checkstyle for typescript. I strongly recommend to use this tool - it will fail a build when some checkstyle rules will be violated.

I'm going to briefly discuss each config file:
 
1. `bs-config.json` Configuration file for lite-server. `ghost-mode` flag disabled synchronization of browsers and files. We're going to test our application on two instances so synchronization should be disabled.
2. `db.json` Our database. This file is used by json-server.
3. `gulfile.js` Config file for gulp. We have three tasks:
    * `watch` - monitoring files changes and rebuilding if necessary,
    * `tslint, build-ts, build-css` - tasks for running tslint, building typescripts and css files,
4. `package.json` Contains npm dependencies for project.
5. `systemjs.config.js` Provides information to a module loader about where to find application modules, and registers all the necessary packages.
6. `tsconfig.json`Defines how the TypeScript compiler generates JavaScript from the project's files.
7. `tslint.json` Contains checkstyle rules for tslint.
8. `typings\globals\es6-shim\index.d.ts` Typings needed by typescript.

# 2 Architecture

<img src="/images/blog/posts/angular2-discussion-portal/architecture.png"/>

As you can see on image we have two components:

#### __DashboardComponent__
This component is responsible for displaying existing posts and an input for creating new one. Data for this component are provided by `PostService`.

#### __PostComponent__ 
Displaying comments created under a particular post. Data for this component are provided by two services: `PostService` and `CommentService`.
`PostService` load post information based on the post id which is url parameter:

{% highlight typescript %}
this.route.params.forEach((params: Params) => {
            if (params[PostComponent.ID_ROUTE_PARAM] !== undefined) {
                let id: number = +params[PostComponent.ID_ROUTE_PARAM];
                this.postService.getPost(id).subscribe(post => {
                    this.post = post;
                    this.refreshData();
                });
            } else {
                this.router.navigate(["/dashboard"]);
            }
        });
{% endhighlight %}

### __Pulling data periodically__
After loading post we run function `refreshData()` which is worth wider discussion.
{% highlight typescript %}
private refreshData(): void {
    this.commentsSubscription = this.commentService.getComments(this.post.id).subscribe(comments => {
        this.comments = comments;
        this.subscribeToData();
    });
}

private subscribeToData(): void {
    this.timerSubscription = Observable.timer(5000).first().subscribe(() => this.refreshData());
}
{% endhighlight %}

This function is responsible for refreshing comments in real time. When someone add a new comment everyone who is reading this post will see it without need for refreshing page.

Firstly, we invoke `commentService.getComments(id: number)` to retrieve comments from the backend. On each success call we run `subscribeToData()` which after 5s invoke once again `refreshData()`.
It ensures that data on UI are constantly refresh.

You may wonder why we invoke `subscribeToData()` after successful call instead of adding in `ngOnInit()` method:
{% highlight typescript %}
this.timerSubscription = Observable.timer(5000).subscribe(() => this.refreshData());
{% endhighlight %}

This code call `refreshData()` after every 5s. The problem occurs when on backend side processing a request takes more than 5s. Then the new request (send after 5s) will begin to queue leading to clogging server.
Invoking `refreshData()` after successful call pretends such behaviour. We have certainty that only one request in time is sent to a backend service.

The same architecture is used in `DashboardComponent` for refreshing dashboard data (all available posts):

{% highlight typescript %}
private refreshData(): void {
    this.postsSubscription = this.postService.getPosts().subscribe(posts => {
        this.posts = posts;
        this.subscribeToData();
    });
}

private subscribeToData(): void {
    this.timerSubscription = Observable.timer(5000).first().subscribe(() => this.refreshData());
}
{% endhighlight %}

Remember that you should unsubscribe from all subscriptions in `ngOnDestroy()` method to prevent memory leaks.

{% highlight typescript %}
public ngOnDestroy(): void {
    if (this.postsSubscription) {
        this.postsSubscription.unsubscribe();
    }
    if (this.timerSubscription) {
        this.timerSubscription.unsubscribe();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### 3 Directories structure
While writing first application in angular2 I was wondering what is the best practise for files structure in the repository. During working with angular2 I worked out structure which is simple and easy to maintain while adding new functionalities.

<img src="/images/blog/posts/angular2-discussion-portal/packages_structure.png"/>

I have three main directories: 

* html - to keep all html files, divided by pages and components. When the new component on dashboard is created new file is added to `html\dashboard`.
* scss - all scss files. Lack of division by components, because basically each page has one scss file.
* ts - typescripts files, divided by pages and type of classes (components/services/models). I also have `shared` directory which contains all code shared between different pages.


### Sum  up
Nowadays frontend code is usually a separate application which communicates with backend. It is necessary to keep this code clean and easy to maintain. When you think about architecture - think not only about backend side, but also about frontend. If you want to refresh data on UI in real time, above architecture is worth considering.
